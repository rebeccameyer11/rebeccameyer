title: "Rebecca Meyer — Data Analytics Portfolio"
---

I’m a Data Analyst with a decade of experience in email marketing, where I learned firsthand how powerful data can be in shaping strategy, improving customer experiences, and driving measurable results. While working across vendor management, nonprofit, and education sectors, I found myself increasingly drawn to the analytical side of my work — digging into performance metrics, spotting trends, and using data to assist team leads in making impactful decisions. That curiosity led me to pursue formal training in data analytics, where I discovered how much I enjoy exploratory analysis, visualization, geospatial analysis, and building insights that tell a clear story.

I’m now focused on combining my marketing background with my analytical skills to solve real business problems. My goal is to continue growing as an analyst by working with complex datasets and building impactful dashboards that support smarter decision-making. I’m especially interested in roles that sit at the intersection of analytics, storytelling, and strategy.

I’m seeking roles on data-driven teams, particularly in marketing analytics, product analytics, or customer insights. I love this field because there’s always something new to learn — each dataset brings fresh patterns to uncover.
