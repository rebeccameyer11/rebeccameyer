---
I’m a Data Analyst with a decade of experience in email marketing, where I learned firsthand how powerful data can be in shaping strategy, improving customer experiences, and driving measurable results. While working across vendor management, nonprofit, and education sectors, I found myself increasingly drawn to the analytical side of my work — digging into performance metrics, spotting trends, and using data to help guide decisions. That curiosity led me to pursue formal training in data analytics, where I discovered how much I enjoy exploratory analysis, visualization, geospatial analysis, and building insights that tell a clear story that help drive decision-making.

I’m now focused on combining my marketing background with my analytical skills to solve real business problems. My goal is to continue growing as an analyst by working with complex datasets, building impactful dashboards, and developing models that support smarter decision-making. I’m especially interested in roles that sit at the intersection of analytics, storytelling, and strategy.

I’m currently looking for opportunities to contribute to data-driven teams — particularly in marketing analytics, product analytics, customer insights, or any environment where understanding user behavior leads to better outcomes. What keeps me excited about this field is the constant learning and that every dataset offers a new pattern to uncover and a new way to help people see their work more clearly.
