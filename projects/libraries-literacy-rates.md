## Overview
For this project, the goal was to determine if public libraries and public library funding help close the literacy gap.

## Skills Used
<ul>
  <li>Collected and evaluated open datasets and API-based time-series data to meet project requirements, including geographic shapefiles.</li>
  <li>Performed comprehensive wrangling, merging, and preprocessing to structure data for exploratory, geospatial, regression, clustering, and time-series analyses.</li>
  <li>Conducted exploratory data analysis using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), developed research questions and hypotheses, and interpreted visual and statistical insights.</li>
  <li>Cleaned and integrated shapefiles, merged geographic data with project datasets, and created choropleth maps to analyze spatial patterns and regional trends.</li>
  <li>Executed linear regression and k-means clustering, including variable selection, train/test splitting, elbow method evaluation, model performance interpretation, and cluster profiling.</li>
  <li>Built a Tableau dashboard/storyboard, published work to Tableau Public, and developed a clear, portfolio-ready GitHub repository documenting the full analytical workflow.</li>
</ul>

## Key Findings
<ul>
  <li>The state with the highest percentage of low literacy individuals is Texas (10.83%).</li>
  <li>The highest density of public libraries are located in the North/Northeast region.</li>
  <li>Individuals who are employed typically fall into the "average literacy" category.</li>
  <li>There is no correlation between any government funding (local, state, federal) and literacy rates.</li>
  <li>Individuals who have a higher literacy rate have a low chance of being under the poverty rate.</li>
  <li>More analysis needs to be done.</li>
</ul>

*Figure 2: Texas has the lowest literacy (11.06% of population) and most public libraries are located in the North/Northeast.*
