## Overview
For this project, the goal was to analyze user behavior to help the business strategy department assess the current logistics model of bike distribution across the city, while also identify expansion opportunities.

## Skills Used
<ul>
<li>Configured GitHub workflows (clone, push/pull, SSH keys) and built Python virtual environments using Anaconda to manage dependencies.</li>
<li>Retrieved structured and unstructured data using APIs and performed ethical web scraping by reviewing site permissions and implementing scraping libraries.</li>
<li>Applied text mining techniques, ran NLP algorithms, generated network-analysis-ready dataframes, and built network graphs with iterative improvements.</li>
<li>Merged, cleaned, and transformed datasets using Python (including apply() and lambda functions) to prepare data for analytical workflows.</li>
<li>Created bar charts, line charts, seaborn plots, FacetGrids, and geospatial visualizations with kepler.gl; evaluated visualization quality and interpreted results.</li>
<li>Designed, built, and deployed dashboards using Plotly and Streamlit (including multi-page apps), applying design principles and presenting analytical findings.</li>

## Key Findings
<ul>
<li>As the weather warms up, the number of trips increase, with June through October showing the highest ridership.</li>
<li>The most popular station is Grove St PATH, followed by South Waterfront Walkway and Hoboken Terminal.</li>
<li>Electric bikes and classic bikes have similar distributions for ridership and at bike stations.</li>
<li>CMembers have the highest ridership during weekdays.</li>
</ul>
